Layer on top of node.js to deal with user profiles in persona. Inspired in great deal by node-prohibition (code looks rather similar).

Stores emails in SHA1 so you never actually store the email.

The purpose of this is to avoid Privacy Terms/Policy. If you need the email you can just ask the user for it. This is intended for apps that do NOT require emails to work.
